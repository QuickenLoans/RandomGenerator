This library, which is written in F#, generates a random string.  It also contains a C# API for generating strings easily from external C# applications/libraries.

The string can contain alpha, numeric, and/or characters (~!@#$%^&*()_+-= etc). 

It can also generate large numbers of strings asynchronously with high randomness (less than .0025% duplication in 100,000 generated strings).
